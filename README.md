**Discover new movies based on plot descriptions, not the movie poster.** Pick-A-Flick is a Tinder-like movie discovery app that challenges you to judge a film by its plot alone. Swipe through descriptions, and if you like what you read, the movie's title and poster are revealed!

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) must be installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/vue-flask-pick-a-flick.git](https://github.com/your_username/vue-flask-pick-a-flick.git)
    cd vue-flask-pick-a-flick
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The backend requires API keys to fetch movie data. Create a `.env` file inside the `api/` directory:
    ```
    api/.env
    ```
    Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file. You will need to get a free API key from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

    ```env
    MOVIE_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
    SECRET_KEY=YOUR_FLASK_SECRET_KEY
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:////db/database.db
    ```

3.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    From the root directory of the project, run the following command to build and start the containers:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    -   The Vue.js frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`
    -   The Flask backend API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`

### Running NPM Scripts (Frontend)

If you wish to run the frontend development server outside of Docker:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
